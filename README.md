# Exploring Weather Trends In Cairo

## Overview

Analyzing local and global temperature data and comparing the temperature trends in Cairo to overall global temperature trends.

## Tools

- SQL
- R (dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, readr, zoo)

## Findings

- The temperature in Cairo is on average hotter than the average of the global temperature.
- The increase in the average temperature is steady and on the rise in both cases.
- This trend shows an overall increase in temperature that has been consistent over the last few hundred years, from which we can expect even more increase in temperature in the coming decades (unless something is done about climate change, of course).
